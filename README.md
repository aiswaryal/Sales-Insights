Problem Statement : Sales director decides to invest in data analysis project and he would like to build power BI dashboard that can give him real time sales insights. 

Database has all sales transactions, customers, products and markets information. We will analyse this database and than hook it up with power BI. In power BI we will perform ETL and data cleaning operations to make it ready so that we can build our dashboard.
