Problem Statement : Sales director decides to invest in data analysis project and he would like to build power BI dashboard that can give him real time sales insights. 

Database has all sales transactions, customers, products and markets information. We will analyse this database.

Plug mysql database with power BI. In power BI we will do data cleaning and ETL (Extract, transform , load). This process is also known as data munging or data wrangling. We will do currency normalization, handling invalid values etc.

Finally we will create the dashboard.
